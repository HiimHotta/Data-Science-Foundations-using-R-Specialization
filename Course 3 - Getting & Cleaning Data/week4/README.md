## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

You should create one R script called [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/HiimHotta/Data-Science-Foundations-using-R-Specialization/blob/main/Course%203%20-%20Getting%20%26%20Cleaning%20Data/week4/run_analysis.R) that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final data can be found [here](https://github.com/HiimHotta/Data-Science-Foundations-using-R-Specialization/tree/main/Course%203%20-%20Getting%20%26%20Cleaning%20Data/week4/tidy_data.txt)

I optimized some functions of my assignment with the code from [here](https://rpubs.com/ninjazzle/DS-JHU-3-4-Final#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Merges%20the%20training,to%20create%20one%20data%20set.&text=Step%202%3A%20Extracts%20only%20the,standard%20deviation%20for%20each%20measurement.&text=Step%203%3A%20Uses%20descriptive%20activity,activities%20in%20the%20data%20set.&text=Step%204%3A%20Appropriately%20labels%20the%20data%20set%20with%20descriptive%20variable%20names.) and I am following the Honor Code of Coursera about Plagiarism as I'm referencing the original author.

The [Codebook.md](https://github.com/HiimHotta/Data-Science-Foundations-using-R-Specialization/blob/main/Course%203%20-%20Getting%20%26%20Cleaning%20Data/week4/CodeBook.md) describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data. 
And the original code has my comments in every step.
